[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/deeplook/dcbot/main?urlpath=lab)

Warning: Because the standard mybinder servers will not allow network access to IMAP/SMTP ports this will actually *not* work using the "launch binder" button above! Running this repo with `repo2docker` locally should work, though.

To get started modify the email and password in `binder/start_bot.sh` before executing the file with bash!
